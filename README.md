Identify Anomalous K8s Behaviours 
Beyond Configuration Rules
Identifying the K8s workloads that contains sensitive information such as access to critical databases throughout their lifecycle is a real challenge.
Alcide kAudit identifies anomalous behaviors and suspicious activity patterns while observing them with extended context, beyond configured rules, such as:


* **Ops/SRE Stolen Credentials** - Detect breaches of cluster admins/operators
* **Detect application breaches** - Detect pivot and breach attempts through the k8s API server
* **Misconfigured RBAC** - Detect and alert on Kubernetes RBAC misconfiguration
* **Detect Exploits of known & unknown Vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes API Server**
* **Violated Security Policies** - Define alert policies for cluster resource adminisrative operations by users & automated services
